This folder collects Jupyter notebooks and Python modules that accompany the CPF bridge topics:

- covariance geometry in a two-asset world,
- the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing in finite-state markets, and
- the Efficient Markets Hypothesis and its core empirical tests.

The materials are designed as minimal, self-contained labs that strip each theme down to its smallest nontrivial setup so you can focus on the core definitions, pictures, and pricing relations without additional modelling overhead.

## Bridge Notes

The code resources here mirror the corresponding bridge notes:

- `covariance/covariance.ipynb` — covariance matrix geometry, ellipses, eigenvalues, and portfolio variance in a two-asset world.
- `ftap/ftap.ipynb` — finite-state, one-period FTAP with explicit two- and three-state examples and price bounds.
- `markets/markets.ipynb` and `markets/markets.py` — Efficient Markets Hypothesis, weak-form tests, and reusable EMH diagnostics in Python.

You can open any notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and step through the cells alongside the associated PDF notes and slide decks.
